## About The Project

Here you can find my configs and a bash file with snippets:

- config.toml &ndash; helix config, really simple
- init.el &ndash; emacs config, I use it from ~/.emacs.d/
- init.vim &ndash; neovim config using vimscript, I use it from ~/.config/nvim
- sn &ndash; a few HTML and Markdown snippets; you need to make it executable and put it in your $PATH
- tmux.conf &ndash; a tmux config, usually ~/.config/tmux
